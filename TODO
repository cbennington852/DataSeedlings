    - the plot section x-values only plots the first x-value but shows all of the predicted values. 
    - maybe also allow for the user to select if they want a bar chart

7. have an accuracy graph so you can see the accuracy

# have the sklearn plotter check to see if there are two open slots, then delete one

8. ### changing the csv viewer to work with pandas, and allow for many file types.  
The user might want to input different types of files, we could parse for diffrent types,

    Make this a 

10. ### allow for autocomplete when filling in x values and y values

11. ### General UI/UX improvements

12. ### Finish the conversion to pandas dataframe viewing.

13. ### Get accuracy scores for the things!!!

14. ### Allow for a k-fold validation.
    Add this as a pipeline object.

15. ### use pd.factorise on the string type columns
